Edunet Internship (AICTE)
This repository showcases the project I developed during my Edunet (AICTE) internship program, focused on applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts to solve real-world problems.

Project Title: University Admission Prediction
The objective of this project is to predict the probability of a student getting admitted to a university based on various academic and profile factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, University Rating, SOP & LOR strength, and Research experience.

Key Highlights:
Performed data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization to understand key factors influencing admission.

Developed a predictive model using Linear Regression, trained and tested for accuracy.

Created an interactive Streamlit web application where users can input their academic credentials to get real-time predictions on their admission chances.

Deployed the application using Ngrok for public access.

This project not only enhanced my technical skills in ML, data handling, and web app development but also provided practical experience in building and deploying AI solutions.
